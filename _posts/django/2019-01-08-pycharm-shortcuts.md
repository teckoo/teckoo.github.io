# Navigation

## case: jump to definition and come back
When browsing code, you need to jump around code quickly.
* To go to the definition, press `Alt/Cmd + B`. 
* To come back, Mac: `Alt+Cmd <-`; Others: `Alt+Ctrl <-`.
  - In vim mode, you can also use `Ctrl o` and `Ctrl i` to come back and forth.

## case: jump to the beginning of a function: 
 * `Cmd + [`: move to the beginning of a function
 * `Cmd + ]`: move the end of a function

## Adjust Font size quickly
1. In setting 'Change font size', enable `'Ctrl/Cmd+MouseWheel'`. 
    This is useful when you are in 'Distract free' mode to focus on one or two files.
