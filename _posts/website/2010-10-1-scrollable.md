Three candidates
--------------------
 * http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html
 * http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/
 * http://www.logicbox.net/jquery/simplyscroll/ (pick this one)
 
Final decision: pick the 3rd one.

Reasons:

1. full tested: jquery 1.2-1.4
2. multiple broswers tested. 
3. simple example
