# Elastic Load Balancing concepts

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. 

# 3 types of load balancers
* Application Load Balancer - for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers. Operating at the *individual request level (Layer 7)*, Application Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on the content of the request.

* Network Load Balancer - for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. Operating at the *connection level (Layer 4)*, Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. Network Load Balancer is also optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.

* Classic Load Balancer - provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at *both the request level and connection level*. Classic Load Balancer is intended for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network.
