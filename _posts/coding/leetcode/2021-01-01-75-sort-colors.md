[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 4:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is 0, 1, or 2.

# Solution

```python
def sortColors(self, nums):
  l = curr = 0
  r = len(nums) - 1
  while curr <= r:
    if nums[curr] == 0:
      nums[l], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[l]
      l += 1
      curr += 1
    elif nums[curr] == 2:
      nums[r], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[r]
      r -= 1
      # note: no curr += 1, may be `2` again
    else:
      curr += 1
```
