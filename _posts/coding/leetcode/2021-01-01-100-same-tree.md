| [Tree template](/template/tree)

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Solution:

```python
def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
    if p is None and q is None: return True
    if p is None or q is None: return False

    return p.val == q.val \
            and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) \
            and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```
