[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

# Solution

1. DFS

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val, neighbors):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors
"""
def __init__(self):
    # Dictionary to save the visited node and it's respective clone
    # as key and value respectively. This helps to avoid cycles.
    self.visited = {}

def cloneGraph(self, node):
    """
    :type node: Node
    :rtype: Node
    """
    if not node:
        return node

    # If the node was already visited before.
    # Return the clone from the visited dictionary.
    if node in self.visited:
        return self.visited[node]

    # Create a clone for the given node.
    # Note that we don't have cloned neighbors as of now, hence [].
    clone_node = Node(node.val, [])

    # The key is original node and value being the clone node.
    self.visited[node] = clone_node

    # Iterate through the neighbors to generate their clones
    # and prepare a list of cloned neighbors to be added to the cloned node.
    if node.neighbors:
        clone_node.neighbors = [self.cloneGraph(n) for n in node.neighbors]

    return clone_node
```

2. BFS

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val, neighbors):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors
"""
from collections import deque

def cloneGraph(self, node):
    """
    :type node: Node
    :rtype: Node
    """

    if not node:
        return node

    # Dictionary to save the visited node and it's respective clone
    # as key and value respectively. This helps to avoid cycles.
    visited = {}

    # Put the first node in the queue
    queue = deque([node])
    # Clone the node and put it in the visited dictionary.
    visited[node] = Node(node.val, [])

    # Start BFS traversal
    while queue:
        # Pop a node say "n" from the from the front of the queue.
        n = queue.popleft()
        # Iterate through all the neighbors of the node
        for neighbor in n.neighbors:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                # Clone the neighbor and put in the visited, if not present already
                visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val, [])
                # Add the newly encountered node to the queue.
                queue.append(neighbor)
            # Add the clone of the neighbor to the neighbors of the clone node "n".
            visited[n].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])

    # Return the clone of the node from visited.
    return visited[node]
```
