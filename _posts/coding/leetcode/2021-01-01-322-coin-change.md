You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

# top-down

```python
def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
    memo = {}
    def dp(n):
        """ get N from subproblems """
        # check result
        if n in memo: return memo[n]
        # base
        if n == 0: return 0
        if n < 0: return -1
        
        # solve sub problems
        res = float("inf")
        for coin in coins:
            sub_res = dp(n - coin)
            if sub_res == -1: continue
            res = min(res, sub_res + 1)
        # save result to memo
        memo[n] = res if res != float("inf") else -1
        return memo[n] 
    return dp(amount)
```

# bottom-up

```python
def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
    # plus base, make array as `size + 1`
    dp = [float("inf")] * (amount + 1)
    # base case
    dp[0] = 0
    # iterate all states
    for i in range(len(dp)):
        # go over each choice
        for coin in coins:
            # skip invalid sub problem
            if (i - coin) < 0: continue
            # check optimal sub-problem   
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float("inf") else -1
```
