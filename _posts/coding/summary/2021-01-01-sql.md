## 1270. All People Report to the Given Manager

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
```

Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

Notes: boss' `manager_id=1` flattens the hirarchy structure.

Solution:

* Inner join 

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM Employees e1,
     Employees e2,
     Employees e3
WHERE e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
  AND e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id
  AND e3.manager_id = 1 
  AND e1.employee_id != 1
;
```
* 3 CTE's with no joins

```sql
WITH CTE1 AS
(Select employee_id
from Employees
where manager_id = 1
),
CTE2 AS
(
Select employee_id from Employees
where manager_id in (Select employee_id from CTE1)
),
CTE3 AS
(Select employee_id from Employees
where manager_id in (Select employee_id from CTE2)
)
Select * from CTE3
where employee_id != 1
```

* Easy union

```sql
WITH cte1 AS
(SELECT employee_id AS secondary
FROM Employees
WHERE manager_id =1 and employee_id <> 1),

cte2 AS(
SELECT employee_id AS third
FROM Employees
JOIN cte1
ON manager_id = secondary),

cte3 AS
(SELECT employee_id AS fourth
FROM Employees
JOIN cte2
ON manager_id = third)

SELECT secondary AS employee_id FROM cte1
UNION
SELECT third AS employee_id FROM cte2
UNION
SELECT fourth AS employee_id FROM cte3;
```

## 1517. Find Users With Valid E-Mails

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| mail          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information of the users signed up in a website. Some e-mails are invalid.
```

Write an SQL query to find the users who have valid emails.

A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where: 

- The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.' and/or dash '-'. The prefix name must start with a letter.
- The domain is '@leetcode.com'.

Solution:

- ^[a-zA-Z] the first character should be only alphanumeric
- [a-zA-Z0-9_.-]* the middle can contain any of these and multiple times (* is for multiple times)
- leetcode.com$ ending should be leetcode.com ($ is for the ending)

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE mail REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*@leetcode.com$'
```

## 1412. Find the Quiet Students in All Exams

Table: Student

```
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| student_id          | int     |
| student_name        | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
student_name is the name of the student.
``` 

Table: Exam

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| exam_id       | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| score         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(exam_id, student_id) is the primary key for this table.
Student with student_id got score points in exam with id exam_id.
```

A "quite" student is the one who took at least one exam and didn't score neither the high score nor the low score.

Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being "quiet" in ALL exams.

Don't return the student who has never taken any exam. Return the result table ordered by student_id.

Solution:

- 1. First we find the students that have scored either highest or lowest scores. These are the students that are noticeable(not quiet).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT e1.student_id 
  FROM   exam e1 
    JOIN (SELECT exam_id, 
                Min(score) AS low, 
                Max(score) AS high 
          FROM   exam 
          GROUP  BY exam_id) e2 
    ON e1.exam_id = e2.exam_id 
  WHERE  e1.score = e2.low 
      OR e1.score = e2.high
```

Secondly we find the students that have participated in at least one exam `SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM   exam`

Combined 1 and 2, final solution:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM   student 
WHERE  student_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT e1.student_id 
              FROM   exam e1 
                      JOIN (SELECT exam_id, 
                                  Min(score) AS low, 
                                  Max(score) AS high 
                            FROM   exam 
                            GROUP  BY exam_id) e2 
                        ON e1.exam_id = e2.exam_id 
              WHERE  e1.score = e2.low 
                      OR e1.score = e2.high) 
       AND student_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT student_id 
                          FROM   exam) 
```

- 2. 
Step 1
Find the student Ids that with highest scores in each exams.

Step 2
Find the student Ids that with lowest scores in each exams. Copy code from step 1 and modify the table names to avoid duplicate columns, and make sure the lowest score is ordered at top 1 rank.

Step 3
Union the student Ids from previous two steps.

Step 4
Filter the student table by join the exam table but remove the student Ids from the step 3.

Here is the complete coding:

```sql
#Step 1
with max_score as
(select s1.student_id from
 (select e1.exam_id, e1.student_id, e1.score, 
  dense_rank() over(partition by e1.exam_id order by e1.score desc) as max_rank from Exam e1
  ) s1
 where max_rank = 1 
),

#Step 2
min_score as
(select s2.student_id from
 (select e2.exam_id, e2.student_id, e2.score, 
  dense_rank() over(partition by e2.exam_id order by e2.score) as min_rank from Exam e2
  ) s2
 where min_rank = 1
),

#Step 3
n_score as
(select distinct max_score.student_id from max_score
union all
select distinct min_score.student_id from min_score
)

#Step 4
select distinct st.student_id, student_name from Student st
join Exam e on st.student_id = e.student_id
where st.student_id not in (select n_score.student_id from n_score)
order by st.student_id
```


## 1204. Last Person to Fit in the Elevator

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id is the primary key column for this table.
This table has the information about all people waiting for an elevator.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
```

The maximum weight the elevator can hold is 1000.

Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person who will fit in the elevator without exceeding the weight limit. It is guaranteed that the person who is first in the queue can fit in the elevator.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Queue table
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name       | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+
| 5         | George Washington | 250    | 1    |
| 3         | John Adams        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | Thomas Jefferson  | 400    | 3    |
| 2         | Will Johnliams    | 200    | 4    |
| 4         | Thomas Jefferson  | 175    | 5    |
| 1         | James Elephant    | 500    | 6    |
+-----------+-------------------+--------+------+

Result table
+-------------------+
| person_name       |
+-------------------+
| Thomas Jefferson  |
+-------------------+
```

Solution: 

- no cte
```sql
SELECT q1.person_name
FROM Queue q1 JOIN Queue q2 ON q1.turn >= q2.turn
GROUP BY q1.turn
HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY SUM(q2.weight) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

- cte
```sql
with cte as (
    select sum,person_name,turn from (
        select sum(weight) over (order by turn) as sum,
        person_name,turn from queue
    )
    where sum <=1000)
Select person_name from cte
where turn=( select max(turn) from cte)
```

- order-by

```sql
with temp as (select turn,
    case when sum(weight) over (order by turn) <= 1000 
    then person_name end as person_name
    from queue)
select person_name from temp
where person_name is not null
order by turn desc
limit 1
```

## 	1212. Team Scores in Football Tournament

```
Table: Teams

+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |
+---------------+----------+
team_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table represents a single football team.

Table: Matches

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     | 
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams. 
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the teams table (team_id) and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals respectively.
``` 

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
A team receives three points if they win a match (Score strictly more goals than the opponent team).
A team receives one point if they draw a match (Same number of goals as the opponent team).
A team receives no points if they lose a match (Score less goals than the opponent team).
Write an SQL query that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches. Result table should be ordered by num_points (decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the records by team_id (increasing order).

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Teams table:
+-----------+--------------+
| team_id   | team_name    |
+-----------+--------------+

| 40         | Chicago FC   | 0             |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT team_id,team_name,
SUM(CASE WHEN team_id=host_team AND host_goals>guest_goals 
    THEN 3 ELSE 0 END)+
SUM(CASE WHEN team_id=guest_team AND guest_goals>host_goals 
    THEN 3 ELSE 0 END)+
SUM(CASE WHEN team_id=host_team AND host_goals=guest_goals 
    THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)+
SUM(CASE WHEN team_id=guest_team AND guest_goals=host_goals 
    THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
as num_points
FROM Teams
LEFT JOIN Matches
ON team_id=host_team OR team_id=guest_team
GROUP BY team_id

## 610. Triangle Judgement

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.
 
```
| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT x, y, z,
    CASE
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x 
        THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS 'triangle'
FROM
    triangle
;
```

## 1194. Tournament Winners

```
Table: Players

+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.

Table: Matches

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belongs to the same group.
```

The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the lowest player_id wins.

Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Players table:
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |

+-----------+------------+
```

Solution: 

* first step, starting point, get play, total_score: 
```sql
select player, sum(score) as score from
	(select first_player as player, first_score as score from Matches
	union all
	select second_player, second_score from Matches) s
group by player
```

* 2nd step, find the player with max score in each group: 
```sql
select group_id, max(score)
from Players,
	(select player, sum(score) as score from
		(select first_player as player, first_score as score from Matches
		union all
		select second_player, second_score from Matches) s
	group by player) PlayerScores
where Players.player_id = PlayerScores.player
group by group_id
```

* final solution: 

```sql
select group_id as GROUP_ID, min(player_id) as PLAYER_ID
from Players,
    (select player, sum(score) as score from
        (select first_player as player, first_score as score from Matches
        union all
        select second_player, second_score from Matches) s
    group by player) PlayerScores

			union all
			select second_player, second_score from Matches) s
		group by player) PlayerScores
	where Players.player_id = PlayerScores.player
	group by group_id)
group by group_id

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called immediate otherwise it's called scheduled.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 5           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-11                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-26                  |
| 5           | 4           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+

Result table:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 33.33                |
+----------------------+
The orders with delivery id 2 and 3 are immediate while the others are scheduled.
```

Solution: 

* Using `sum`
```sql
select round(100 * sum(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) 
/ count(*), 2) as immediate_percentage from Delivery;
```

* Using `count`
```sql
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(IF(order_date=customer_pref_delivery_date, delivery_id, null)) / COUNT(delivery_id) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage FROM Delivery
```

## 1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

```
Table: Activity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
``` 

Write an SQL query to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on some day if he/she made at least one activity on that day.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+ 
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+ 
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
+------------+--------------+ 
Note that we do not care about days with zero active users.
```

Solution: 

```sql
select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users 
from Activity
where datediff('2019-07-27', activity_date) <30
group by activity_date
```

or 
```sql
select activeity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from activity
group by active_date
having (active_date <='2019-07-27' and active_date > '2019-06-27')
```

## 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

```
The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.
```

Solution:

```sql
select  avg(n.Number) median from Numbers n
where n.Frequency >= abs(
    (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number<=n.Number) 
    -
    (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number>=n.Number)
    )
```                         

## 1126. Active Businesses

```
Table: Events

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurences    | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occured at some business for a number of times.
``` 

Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.

An active business is a business that has more than one event type with occurences greater than the average occurences of that event type among all businesses.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Events table:
+-------------+------------+------------+
| business_id | event_type | occurences |
+-------------+------------+------------+
| 1           | reviews    | 7          |
| 3           | reviews    | 3          |
| 1           | ads        | 11         |
| 2           | ads        | 7          |
| 3           | ads        | 6          |
| 1           | page views | 3          |
| 2           | page views | 12         |
+-------------+------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| business_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+ 
Average for 'reviews', 'ads' and 'page views' are (7+3)/2=5, (11+7+6)/3=8, (3+12)/2=7.5 respectively.
Business with id 1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8) so it is an active business.
```

Solution:

```sql
select business_id
from
(select event_type, avg(occurences) as ave_occurences
 from events as e1
 group by event_type
) as temp1
join events as e2 on temp1.event_type = e2.event_type
where e2.occurences > temp1.ave_occurences
group by business_id
having count(distinct temp1.event_type) > 1
```

## 1164. Product Price at a Given Date

```
Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
``` 

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
```

Solution:

```sql
-- first part is for default price 10
select distinct product_id, 10 as price
from Products
group by product_id
having (min(change_date) > "2019-08-16")

union
-- get most recent price change
select p2.product_id, new_price
from Products p2
where (p2.product_id, p2.change_date) in
    (
    select product_id, max(change_date) as recent_date
    from Products
    where change_date <= "2019-08-16"
    group by product_id
    )
```

## 603. Consecutive Available Seats

Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following `cinema` table?

```
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
``` 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 
```
| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
```

Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

Solution:

```sql
select distinct a.seat_id
from cinema a join cinema b
  on abs(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1
  and a.free = 1 and b.free = 1
order by a.seat_id
;
```

## 534. Game Play Analysis III

```
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
``` 

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.
```

Solution:

* join
```sql
select a1.player_id, a1.event_date, 
sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from activity as a1
inner join activity as a2
    on a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
    and a1.player_id = a2.player_id
group by  a1.player_id, a1.event_date
```

* window function
```sql
select player_id,
event_date,
sum(games_played) over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as games_played_so_far
from activity a
group by player_id, event_date
order by player_id, event_date
;
```

## 550. Game Play Analysis IV

```
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
``` 

Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(t2.player_id)/COUNT(t1.player_id),2) AS fraction
FROM
(SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login 
FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id) t1 
LEFT JOIN Activity t2
ON t1.player_id = t2.player_id 
AND t1.first_login = t2.event_date - 1
```

* use case
```sql
select round(
    sum(case when temp.min_date + 1 = a.event_date then 1 else 0 end)
    /
    count(distinct temp.player_id), 2) as fraction
from (select player_id, min(event_date) as min_date from activity group by player_id) as temp
join activity a
on temp.player_id = a.player_id
```

## 1336. Number of Transactions per Visit

```
Table: Visits

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, visit_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has visited the bank in visit_date.

Table: Transactions

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| user_id          | int     |
| transaction_date | date    |
| amount           | int     |
+------------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has done a transaction of amount in transaction_date.
It is guaranteed that the user has visited the bank in the transaction_date.(i.e The Visits table contains (user_id, transaction_date) in one row)
``` 

A bank wants to draw a chart of the number of transactions bank visitors did in one visit to the bank and the corresponding number of visitors who have done this number of transaction in one visit.

**Write an SQL query to find how many users visited the bank and didn't do any transactions, how many visited the bank and did one transaction and so on.**

The result table will contain two columns:

transactions_count which is the number of transactions done in one visit.
visits_count which is the corresponding number of users who did transactions_count in one visit to the bank.
transactions_count should take all values from 0 to max(transactions_count) done by one or more users.

Order the result table by transactions_count.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Visits table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | visit_date |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2020-01-01 |
| 2       | 2020-01-02 |
| 12      | 2020-01-01 |
| 19      | 2020-01-03 |
| 1       | 2020-01-02 |
| 2       | 2020-01-03 |
| 1       | 2020-01-04 |
| 7       | 2020-01-11 |
| 9       | 2020-01-25 |
| 8       | 2020-01-28 |
+---------+------------+
Transactions table:
+---------+------------------+--------+
| user_id | transaction_date | amount |
+---------+------------------+--------+
| 1       | 2020-01-02       | 120    |
| 2       | 2020-01-03       | 22     |
| 7       | 2020-01-11       | 232    |
| 1       | 2020-01-04       | 7      |
| 9       | 2020-01-25       | 33     |
| 9       | 2020-01-25       | 66     |
| 8       | 2020-01-28       | 1      |
| 9       | 2020-01-25       | 99     |
+---------+------------------+--------+
Result table:
+--------------------+--------------+
| transactions_count | visits_count |
+--------------------+--------------+
| 0                  | 4            |
| 1                  | 5            |
| 2                  | 0            |
| 3                  | 1            |
+--------------------+--------------+
```

* For transactions_count = 0, The visits (1, "2020-01-01"), (2, "2020-01-02"), (12, "2020-01-01") and (19, "2020-01-03") did no transactions so visits_count = 4.
* For transactions_count = 1, The visits (2, "2020-01-03"), (7, "2020-01-11"), (8, "2020-01-28"), (1, "2020-01-02") and (1, "2020-01-04") did one transaction so visits_count = 5.
* For transactions_count = 2, No customers visited the bank and did two transactions so visits_count = 0.
* For transactions_count = 3, The visit (9, "2020-01-25") did three transactions so visits_count = 1.
* For transactions_count >= 4, No customers visited the bank and did more than three transactions so we will stop at transactions_count = 3

Solution:

```sql
WITH t AS (SELECT v.user_id as user_id, visit_date, count(t.transaction_date) as transaction_count
            FROM Visits v LEFT JOIN Transactions t on v.visit_date = t.transaction_date and v.user_id=t.user_id
            GROUP BY 1, 2),

    row_nums AS (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER () as rn

## 1321. Restaurant Growth

```
Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) have visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
``` 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Write an SQL query to compute moving average of how much customer paid in a 7 days window (current day + 6 days before) .

The query result format is in the following example:

Return result table ordered by visited_on.

average_amount should be rounded to 2 decimal places, all dates are in the format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

```
Customer table:
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| customer_id | name         | visited_on   | amount      |

```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT a.visited_on AS visited_on, SUM(b.day_sum) AS amount,
       ROUND(AVG(b.day_sum), 2) AS average_amount
FROM
  (SELECT visited_on, SUM(amount) AS day_sum FROM Customer GROUP BY visited_on ) a,
  (SELECT visited_on, SUM(amount) AS day_sum FROM Customer GROUP BY visited_on ) b
WHERE DATEDIFF(a.visited_on, b.visited_on) BETWEEN 0 AND 6 
-- To make sure the rolling sum and rolling avg are only calculated in a 7-day window 
GROUP BY a.visited_on
HAVING COUNT(b.visited_on) = 7 -- This is to make sure it starts from the 7th day since only if it reaches the 7th day there will be 7 days that are 0-6 days
-- prior to the current days (e.g. for the first day, there's only itself that is 0-6 days prior to itself; and for the second day it's itself and the day prior, etc.,).

## 1132. Reported Posts II

```
Table: Actions

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    |
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action such as a reason for report or a type of reaction. 
Table: Removals

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| post_id       | int     |
| remove_date   | date    | 
+---------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that some post was removed as a result of being reported or as a result of an admin review.
``` 

**Write an SQL query to find the average for daily percentage of posts that got removed after being reported as spam, rounded to 2 decimal places.**

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+

Result table:
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts was removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.
```

Solution:

First calculate the daily percentage by joining the Actions table and the Removels table after we filtered out the posts that have been reported as 'spam'.
And then we can calculate the general average based on the daily average we calculated from the subquery.

```sql
select round(sum(percent)/count(distinct action_date),2) as average_daily_percent
from
    (select a.action_date,
    count(distinct r.post_id)/count(distinct a.post_id)*100 as percent
    from actions a left join removals r
    on a.post_id = r.post_id
    where a.extra='spam'
    group by 1) temp;
```

## 512. Game Play Analysis II

```
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
```

**Write a SQL query that reports the device that is first logged in for each player.**

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |

| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+-----------+
| player_id | device_id |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 3         |
| 3         | 1         |
+-----------+-----------+
```

Solution:

```sql
select player_id, device_id 
from activity 
where (player_id, event_date) in (
    select player_id, min(event_date)
    from activity 
    group by player_id
    ) 
```

## 1097. Game Play Analysis V

```
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
```

We define the `install date` of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define `day 1 retention` of some date X to be the number of players whose install date is X and they logged back in on the day right after X, divided by the number of players whose install date is X, rounded to 2 decimal places.

**Write an SQL query that reports for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day and the day 1 retention.**

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+----------------+
| install_dt | installs | Day1_retention |
+------------+----------+----------------+
| 2016-03-01 | 2        | 0.50           |
| 2017-06-25 | 1        | 0.00           |
+------------+----------+----------------+
Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00
```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT install_dt, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT a1.player_id) installs, 
    ROUND(SUM(CASE 
                WHEN DATEDIFF(event_date, install_dt) = 1 THEN 1 
                ELSE 0 END)/
          COUNT(DISTINCT a1.player_id), 2) Day1_retention 
FROM
    (
        SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) install_dt
        FROM Activity
        GROUP BY player_id
    ) a1
JOIN Activity a2
ON a1.player_id = a2.player_id
GROUP BY install_dt
```

## 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |

|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
```
Note: No one would report to himself.

Solution:

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Employee AS t1 JOIN
    (SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee
    GROUP BY ManagerId
    HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5) AS t2
ON t1.Id = t2.ManagerId

+----------+---------+-------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT 
LEFT(trans_date, 7) AS month, country, 
COUNT(id) AS trans_count, 
SUM(state = 'approved') AS approved_count, 
SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount, 
SUM(CASE 
    WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount 
    ELSE 0 
    END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country

```sql
SELECT student.student_id,student.student_name,subject.subject_name,COUNT(exam.subject_name) as attended_exams
FROM Students as student
JOIN Subjects as subject
LEFT JOIN Examinations as exam
ON student.student_id=exam.student_id AND subject.subject_name=exam.subject_name
GROUP BY student.student_id,subject.subject_name
ORDER BY student_id,subject_name;
```

## 1285. Find the Start and End Number of Continuous Ranges

```
Table: Logs

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+

```

Solution:

* Window Function

```sql
SELECT gender, day, 
       SUM(score_points) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY day) AS total
FROM Scores
```

* self-join

```sql
SELECT s1.gender, s1.day, SUM(s2.score_points) AS total
FROM Scores AS s1,
     Scores AS s2
WHERE s1.gender = s2.gender AND s2.day <= s1.day
GROUP BY s1.gender, s1.day

## 1393. Capital Gain/Loss

```
Table: Stocks

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(stock_name, operation_day) is the primary key for this table.
The operation column is an ENUM of type ('Sell', 'Buy')
Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day.
``` 

**Write an SQL query to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.**

The capital gain/loss of a stock is total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:
 
```
Stocks table:
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| stock_name    | operation | operation_day | price  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 2             | 10     |
| Leetcode      | Sell      | 5             | 9000   |
| Handbags      | Buy       | 17            | 30000  |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 3             | 1010   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 4             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 5             | 500    |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 6             | 1000   |
| Handbags      | Sell      | 29            | 7000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 10            | 10000  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+

Result table:
+---------------+-------------------+
| stock_name    | capital_gain_loss |
+---------------+-------------------+
| Corona Masks  | 9500              |
| Leetcode      | 8000              |
| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.
```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT stock_name, SUM(
    CASE
        WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN -price
        ELSE price
    END
) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name
```

## 613. Shortest Distance in a Line

Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.

**Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.**
 
```
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
``` 

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 
```
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
``` 

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

Solution:

```sql
SELECT
    p1.x, p2.x, ABS(p1.x - p2.x) AS distance
FROM point p1 JOIN point p2 
ON p1.x != p2.x
;
```

## 1113. Reported Posts

```
Table: Actions

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    | 
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action such as a reason for report or a type of reaction. 
``` 

**Write an SQL query that reports the number of posts reported yesterday for each report reason. Assume today is 2019-07-05.**

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Result table:
+---------------+--------------+
| report_reason | report_count |
+---------------+--------------+
| spam          | 1            |
| racism        | 2            |
+---------------+--------------+ 
Note that we only care about report reasons with non zero number of reports.
```

Solution:

```sql
select extra as report_reason, count(distinct post_id) as report_count
from Actions
where action_date = '2019-07-04'
  and action = 'report'
group by extra
```

## 607. Sales Person

output

```
+------+
| name | 
+------+
| Amy  | 
| Mark | 
| Alex |
+------+
```

Explanation

According to order '3' and '4' in table orders, it is easy to tell only salesperson 'John' and 'Pam' have sales to company 'RED',
so we need to output all the other names in the table salesperson.

Solution:

```sql
SELECT s.name FROM salesperson s
WHERE
    s.sales_id NOT IN (SELECT o.sales_id
        FROM orders o LEFT JOIN company c 
        ON o.com_id = c.com_id
        WHERE
            c.name = 'RED')
;
```

| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
``` 

Follow up: What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?

Each row of this table contains the caller id, callee id and the duration of the call in minutes. caller_id != callee_id
```

A telecommunications company wants to invest in new countries. The company intends to **invest in the countries where the average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration.**

**Write an SQL query to find the countries where this company can invest.**

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:
 
```
Person table:
+----+----------+--------------+
| id | name     | phone_number |
+----+----------+--------------+
| 3  | Jonathan | 051-1234567  |
| 12 | Elvis    | 051-7654321  |
| 1  | Moncef   | 212-1234567  |
| 2  | Maroua   | 212-6523651  |
| 7  | Meir     | 972-1234567  |
| 9  | Rachel   | 972-0011100  |
+----+----------+--------------+

Country table:
+----------+--------------+
| name     | country_code |
+----------+--------------+
| Peru     | 051          |
| Israel   | 972          |
| Morocco  | 212          |
| Germany  | 049          |
| Ethiopia | 251          |
+----------+--------------+

Calls table:
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| caller_id | callee_id | duration |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| 1         | 9         | 33       |
| 2         | 9         | 4        |
| 1         | 2         | 59       |
| 3         | 12        | 102      |
| 3         | 12        | 330      |
| 12        | 3         | 5        |
| 7         | 9         | 13       |
| 7         | 1         | 3        |
| 9         | 7         | 1        |
| 1         | 7         | 7        |
+-----------+-----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+
| country  |
+----------+
| Peru     |
+----------+
The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 102 + 330 + 330 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 8 = 9.37500
The average call duration for Morocco is (33 + 4 + 59 + 59 + 3 + 7) / 6 = 27.5000 
Global call duration average = (2 * (33 + 4 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7)) / 20 = 55.70000
Since Peru is the only country where average call duration is greater than the global average, it's the only recommended country.
```

Solution:

```sql
SELECT Country.name AS country
FROM Person JOIN Calls ON Calls.caller_id = Person.id OR Calls.callee_id = Person.id
JOIN Country ON Country.country_code = LEFT(Person.phone_number, 3)
GROUP BY Country.name
HAVING AVG(duration) > (SELECT AVG(duration) FROM Calls)
```
