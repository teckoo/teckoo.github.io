1. search index and sourcetype: index=your_app sourcetype=your_metrics

2. include traceid events: index=your_app sourcetype=your_metrics
TRACE_ID="<traceid>"

3. expand search to 60 minutes and events where response time is greater than
5ms:  earliest=-60m latest=now EXE_TIME>5

4. find count(volume), average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation: 
earliest=-60m latest=now EXE_TIME>5 | stats counts as volume, avg(EXE_TIME),
min(EXE_TIME) as minimum, max(EXE_TIME) as maximum, stdev(EXE_TIME) as stddev

5. group by operation:  index=your_app sourcetype=your_metrics
TRACE_ID="<traceid>" earliest=-60m latest=now EXE_TIME>5 | stats counts as volume, avg(EXE_TIME),
min(EXE_TIME) as minimum, max(EXE_TIME) as maximum, stdev(EXE_TIME) as stddev
by OPERATION
