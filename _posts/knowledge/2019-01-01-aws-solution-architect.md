This site has many questions to practice.

### FAQs
* Is in-classroom training necessary?
    Not absolute needed in my opinion. Too expensive, too little details. 

* What about online courses?
    Amazon provides some free online courses. Good to watch, but not enough. 

    Third-party websites such as "A Cloud Guru" and "Cloud Academy" are great.     
    "A Cloud Guru" annual membership $300/year. 
    "Cloud Academy" $79/month. 
    Qwiklabs provides excellent labs too.
    Pro: 
        * You can adjust play speed
        * review multiple times
        * check out exam tips
        * exam simulator is an excellent practice before shooting real target

* Whitepapers
    * You don't have to read them all. 
    * read all overview/big picture ones, e.g. "Architecting for the cloud: AWS best practices", "AWS secruity best practices"
    * read topics you are not familiar.

* Videos
    * AWS event videos on youtube: re:Invent sessions
        * youtube.com/user/AmazonWebServices/playlists
        * foundation videos
        * 400-level are very useful
        * slideshare hosts the slides in video sessions
    
* Case studies
    * google "aws case studies", on amazon.com too.
