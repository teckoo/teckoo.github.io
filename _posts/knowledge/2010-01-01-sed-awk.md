Sed and awk belong to GNU 'coreutils' group. But these two are much more complicated 
than other utilities due to their programming abilities. Therefore I list them separately 
for some usage scenarios. 

# Sed usage examples

## use sed to remove leading and trailing spaces

    echo $var | sed -e 's/^ *//g' -e 's/ *$//g'

  another simple solution is 

    echo $var | xargs

## get the last day of the month

    cal "${month}" "${year}" | sed '/^[ \t]*$/d' | tail -1 \
    | sed 's/^.* //'

## replace a string in a file with sed

    sed -ie 's/string_1/string_2/g' *.jsp

# AWK usage examples
Awk stands for the names of its authors "Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan".

Note: be careful about quotes and semicolon in statements. 

Simple Syntax:

    awk '/search pattern1/ {Actions}
         /search pattern2/ {Actions}' file

Complete Syntax:

    BEGIN { Actions}
    {ACTION} # Action for everyline in a file
    END { Actions }

    '#' is for comments in Awk

## print some fields of a text file
example: print 2nd column and the last column of a file. 

    awk '{print $2,$NF;}' sample_file.dat

## print lines with searching patterns

    awk '/my_string1|my_string2/' sample_file.dat

## generate formatted report

    awk 'BEGIN {print "Name\tGroup\tParent"; count=0}
        {print $2, "\t", $5, "\t", $NF-1; count++; }
        END {print "---------------\n"; print count," records processed.\n";}' sample_file.dat
